    <h2 id="chan">A Lawless Proposition (Paul Chan, 2011)</h2>
    <blockquote>Art appears when what is made feels as if there is a profound misunderstanding at the hear of what it is, as if it were made with the wrong use in mind, or the wrong idea about what it is capable of, or simply the wrong set of assumptions about what it means to fully function in the world. A work works by not working at all. By not obeying the law of any systems or authority external to the process of its own making, a work enphatically expresses its own right to exist for itself and in itself, and questions &mdash; by merely existing &mdash; the rule of law that works to bind all to a semblance of the common good.</blockquote>
    
    <p>Chan writes about the art object as the thing which exists in defiance of external rules, following instead the inner tendencies and intuitions of the artist. An art object seems to arise from a misunderstanding of what it means to fully function in the world. I'm curious what this means for a website.</p>
    <p>Websites have function, and they function according to laws more rigid than any made to govern the behavior of citizens. The constraints of the web, HTML, the browser, the screen create a strict box around what is and isn't possible within the context of a website. Beyond technical constraints there are the user constraints of convention. All digital natives have instincts and expectations for websites, and a website is functional by its adherance to these expectaionts. Out of the &ldquo;by the book&rdquo; conventions which govern art in the internet age, the specific genre of the artist&rsquo;s website too has a function. An artist&rsquo;s website exists to chronicle and communicate an artist&rsquo;s work. If an artist makes art and there is no record of it online, did they ever make art? Gat argues for the artist&rsquo;s website as an art object itself. By Chan&rsquo;s definition, this can never succeed. Function and art-iness are inversely correlated. A website which succeeds as art cannot succeed in the convention-dictated function of the artist&rsquo;s website.</p>

    <p>Balkin and Michaelson discuss some of the same themes as Chan but from the perspective of design. Michaelson pushes his students not just to create static designs but to create platforms which allow others to produce designs (or to populate designs with their own content). These platforms allow some creative decisions and close off others. These aren't always the decisions that the author of the platform intended, or the decisions that the social context of the platform would prefer, and here becomes visible the different governances on a website. As previously discussed, a website exists under technical (and artistic) constraints. Balkin adds social constraints and constraints of authority.</p>
    <p>What does this mean for the artist's website? An artist&rsquo;s website doesn't have to be used by multiple people. Platform need not be developed separately from content. A lot of interesting things can be said by making an artist website publicly-editable, but it can be perfectly successful without that. When one person owns completely a website there may not even be an advantage to a platform. In fact unless the platform is essential to some artistic gesture, the making of the platform almost certainly marks the work as design and not art; the difference between a magazine layout and a painting.</p>
